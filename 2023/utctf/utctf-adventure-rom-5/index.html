<p>I ran the game.gb file on the BGB GameBoy Emulator.</p>
<p>The game is a maze that allows the user avatar to fall through a left or a right channel a total 10 times before displaying the end of game screens.
If you fall through the channels in incorrect ordering, you lose the game.</p>
<p>To find the way through the maze, I looked for patterns that would indicate the order in the debugging console.<br>

<p>There are 10 lines with the suffix &quot;joypad&quot;. If &quot;a&quot; is before &quot;(ff00 + 00)&quot;, go through the right channel; otherwise go through the left. That
would take you to the end of game screen with the flag.</p>
