<p>We connected to the samba share via Dolphin and found a file named <code>notetoIT</code> in <code>/WorkShares/shares/IT/Itstuff/</code>.</p>
<pre><code>I don't understand the fasination with the magic phrase &quot;abracadabra&quot;, but too many people are using them as passwords. Crystal Ball, Wade Coldwater, Jay Walker, and Holly Wood all basically have the same password. Can you please reach out to them and get them to change thier passwords or at least get them append a special character?
